### creating a folder
1. create a folder and name it `ap-subject` (look at others for reference)
2. do this by clicking add file at the top of the page
3. in the file name, type `/ap-subject/index.ts` to create the folder and first file
4. paste the `index.ts` text from [TEMPLATE](https://github.com/studyaporg/prompts/tree/main/TEMPLATE) into the textbox

### creating the second file
5. within the folder, add another file in the same way you created the folder
6. this time, call the file config.ts
7. paste the `config.ts` text from [TEMPLATE](https://github.com/studyaporg/prompts/tree/main/TEMPLATE) into the textbox

### editing values   
9. within index.ts, change line 5 to say `const cleanup = initializeOtel("generator-cli:ap-subject")`, changing ap-subject to the subject
10. in config.ts, follow the instructions and change all values within two asterisks (use other subjects for reference)
